# frontend/CLAUDE.md

React 18 + TypeScript + webpack 5 + Redux. Entry: `src/app/Main.tsx`. Dev server on `:3000` proxies REST and WebSocket to backend on `:8324`. See root `CLAUDE.md` for repo-wide constraints.

## Run

- Dev (full stack): `bash run.sh`.
- Dev (frontend only): `bash frontend/run.sh` — runs `npm install` then `npm run dev`.
- No JS/TS test runner is wired up. Changes must be manually exercised in the running app before merging.

## Key concepts

- **Spatial dashboard** — agents are draggable nodes on a canvas; layout + selection state lives in Redux.
- **Settings draft persistence** — `AppSettings.dismissed_mcp_suggestions` is a map of MCP id → ISO timestamp; preserve this shape when modifying settings serialization.
- **Onboarding wizard** (`src/app/pages/Onboarding/`) — 8-step agentic cursor walkthrough. Cursor offsets, fit-to-view, AC popup timing, and group-meta dedup were each delicate to land; verify visually after touching this code.
- **Custom providers** — `AppSettings.custom_providers: CustomProvider[]` supports any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g. LM Studio).

## Conventions

- TS only; no PropTypes.
- No eslint/prettier config — match nearby files.
- Onboarding-copy placeholders shaped like real API keys (`sk-ant-api03-…`) are already allowlisted in `.gitleaks.toml`. Reuse the existing placeholder rather than introducing new "example" tokens.
- MCP suggestion UI must surface only the vetted/default set — never expose the full upstream registry to users.

## Pitfalls

- Direct LLM calls from the frontend bypass the backend's provider routing and MCP gate. Don't add them; route through `/api/*` instead.
- Webpack-dev-server hot reload occasionally loses WS state — full page reload after backend restarts.
