"""Per-install auth token for the localhost API.

OpenSwarm's backend runs a FastAPI server on `127.0.0.1:<random-port>`
and streams sensitive agent data (tool inputs, approval requests,
messages) over WebSockets. Without auth, any webpage loaded in any
browser on the same machine can connect to those endpoints — WebSockets
aren't subject to Same-Origin Policy — and impersonate the user.

This module issues a cryptographically random token on first boot,
writes it 0600 to `<DATA_ROOT>/auth.token`, and reuses it on subsequent
restarts (so dev-mode hot-reload doesn't break the renderer's cached
copy). The token is regenerated only when the file is missing or empty.
Only code running as the same OS user can read the file.

Delivery to legitimate consumers:

- Electron main process reads the file and exposes it to the renderer
  via a contextBridge method in preload.js (NOT plain window global).
- Our Python MCP subprocesses receive it via env var
  `OPENSWARM_AUTH_TOKEN` that agent_manager passes when spawning.
- The Claude Code CLI we spawn receives it as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in
  env; the anthropic-proxy route trusts that value.

None of those paths are accessible from a third-party webpage.

    Behaviour: prefer an existing token on disk; only mint a fresh one
    when the file is absent or empty. This matters for two cases:

      1. Dev mode (`bash run.sh`) — uvicorn's WatchFiles reload restarts
         the worker process and re-runs init_auth_token. If we generated
         a fresh token every reload, Electron's cached token (read once
         at app boot) would mismatch and every authed request 401s
         until the user fully restarts. Preserving the on-disk token
         keeps Electron and the backend in sync across reloads.

      2. Packaged builds — the user can restart the backend (Quit + reopen)
         without the renderer reloading. Same mismatch risk, same fix.

    Security trade-off: we no longer rotate the token on every restart.
    The threat model that rotation was protecting against (a stale token
    sitting in a log/crash dump being usable later) is marginal — anyone
    who can read the artifact can also re-read the on-disk token, and
    real rotation requires the file to be deleted (e.g. by signing out
    or wiping the data root). Net: dev-mode reliability wins.
