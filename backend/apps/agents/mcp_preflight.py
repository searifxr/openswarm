"""Pre-flight MCP suggestion classifier.

Runs before a new agent launches. Given the user's initial prompt, decides:
  1. Is this prompt vague or information-gathering (is_vague) — used to
     conditionally inject the discovery scaffolding into the system prompt.
  2. Does it suggest a not-yet-connected MCP that would dramatically
     improve the outcome — surfaced to the user as a one-click
     "Connect X" modal before the agent runs.

Only the curated shortlist of MCPs we ship and have vetted is considered.
The full community MCP registry is NOT mined for suggestions — flaky/
unvetted entries would make the "magic" moment feel broken.

Provider-agnostic: calls whatever cheap-tier aux model the user has wired
via `resolve_aux_model` (Haiku / GPT-5.4-mini / Gemini-2.5-flash / etc.).
If no provider is connected, fails open (no suggestions, no scaffolding).
