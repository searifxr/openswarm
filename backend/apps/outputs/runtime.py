"""Per-workspace persistent backend runtime.

Each App (workspace) has at most one long-running `backend.py` subprocess
managed by `AppRuntime`. Lifetime is reference-counted via the module-level
`manager` singleton: when the first ViewEditor / DashboardViewCard /
TerminalPanel attaches to a workspace, the process is spawned; when the
last detaches, it's terminated. Multiple subscribers share the same
process and the same in-memory log ring buffer.

This replaces the old one-shot `execute_backend_code` model for the
"backend serves real HTTP endpoints" use case. The one-shot path stays
around (see `executor.py`) for legacy `/api/outputs/execute` callers.

# probes are cheap (async open_connection on localhost, no DNS, no
# handshake to a real upstream) and shave the perceived cold-start by
# roughly half a second. The asyncio.open_connection call has its own

# "frontend ready" log line — or by the timeout / failure paths.
#
# Why a module-level asyncio.Lock and not part of AppRuntimeManager:
